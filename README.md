# qnect

Qnect is a blind dating platform that aims to increase genuine perspective and personality in the dating industry. By utilizing an exclusively no-photo environment, Qnect operates uniquely to ask a user's perspective and personality questions, an AI will calculate a compatibility score for matched users, create responses in the ChatBot adapted towards questions asked by the user, and recommend tailored short-read articles for users in the explore page.

Abiding by similar structures of common dating apps, users will be able to swipe, like, and pass other users. When swiping through, instead of pictures of another user, the preliminary perspective questions that they answered when creating their profile and their answers will appear. They can see their matches - when the user they liked also liked them - and initialize a personal chat box between the two users.

In addition, the matched users can now see the other's social profiles, connecting them closer. The main goal is to foster genuine connections between others and mitigate appearance bias in dating, allowing people of different perspectives and backgrounds to "match" with one another. After all, a match is simply a matter of aligning perspectives.

Tech Stack

Qnect is built utilizing the MEVN stack. The front-end incorporates Vue.js, while MongoDB is used for storage, Express.js is utilized on back-end server side CRUD operations.

The Groq LLM API powers Qnect's similarity score generation, explore page algorithm, and chatbot responses. The Imentiv AI API is used for voice emotion detection with the chat bot.

This combination allows Qnect to present a secure, reliable, and fast platform for users to meet their perfect match.
