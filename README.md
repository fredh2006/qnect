# qnect

Qnect is a blind dating platform that aims to increase genuine perspective and personality in the dating industry. By utilizing an exclusively no-photo environment, Qnect operates uniquely to ask a user's perspective and personality questions, an AI will calculate a compatibility score for matched users, create responses in the ChatBot adapted towards questions asked by the user, and recommend tailored short-read articles for users in the explore page.

Abiding by similar structures of common dating apps, users will be able to swipe, like, and pass. When swiping through, instead of pictures of another user, the preliminary perspective questions that they answered when creating their profile and their answers will appear. They can then see and interact with their matches.

__Tech Stack__

Qnect is built utilizing the MEVN stack. The front-end incorporates __Vue.js__, while __MongoDB__ is used for storage, __Express.js__ is utilized on back-end server side CRUD operations.

The __Groq LLM API__ powers Qnect's similarity score generation, explore page algorithm, and chatbot responses. The __Imentiv AI API__ is used for voice emotion detection with the chat bot.

This combination allows Qnect to present a secure, reliable, and fast platform for users to meet their perfect match.
